- Before i started working on this assignment i spoke with Ed about what he wanted for the page.

- Ed requested for a product page that consisted of headline, button, text, and an image.

- Getting the components part together was straightforward.

- We struggled with content part because we couldn't get page visual to show.

- After Fesal explained by using your demo space it's possible, the visual page worked.

- All i had to do was click on add a block and find my folder that is in the components at the bottom and add it to page body.

- My VS Code decided not to comply and auto formate json file.

- I reached out for help in slack and Bryan tried getting my VS Code to formate to no avail.

- Later i reached out to Ash for a solution and Ash recommended https://jsonformatter.org/ and that fixed the formatting issue with json file.
